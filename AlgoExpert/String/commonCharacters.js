/*
    Time complexity: O(nâˆ—m)

    Here n is the number of words in the input array and m is the length of the longest word.
    This is because the algorithm iterates through each word in the array once and performs a constant amount of work for each character in each word.

    Space complexity: O(k)

    Here k is the number of distinct characters across all the words.
    This is because the algorithm creates a Map object to store the frequency of each character, which has a space complexity proportional to the number of distinct keys (characters) it contains.
